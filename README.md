# University Project for the Artificial Intelligence course in FMI (Sofia University), 1st Semester 2020/2021

A simple Edge Detection project, using OpenCV, plus Tesseract for OCR. The idea is to take photos of documents, cut out the background and rotate the image appropriately to look like a properly scanned document. OCR can also be applied to try to produce a text file with the contents of the document.
